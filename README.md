# Cellular-Automata-for-Air-Borne-Infectious-Diseases
Airborne infectious diseases present significant challenges to public health,
necessitating the development of effective modelling tools for understanding
and mitigating their spread. The study incorporates parameters derived from relevant literature and conducts
simulations using cellular automata to evaluate the impact of different intervention strategies, such as
social distancing and lockdown measures. This  provides valuable insights into the best ways to control airborne
infectious disease outbreaks.
